Monday 22/07:

    - Reminder from the supervisor to keep an update.txt file on Git with daily progress because of remote work.
    - Told to re-test speech-to-speech conversion, justify decisions in writing, and improve TTS sync with video start.
    - Started working on the script to detect the start of speech in videos.
    - Began refactoring code in various units and classes for better structure and clarity.
    - Added comments to the code for better documentation and readability.


Tuesday 23/07:

    - Continued working on the speech detection script.
    - ##Encountered an issue##: the script always records 29 seconds instead of 9. Tried to figure out the issue but no luck yet.
    - Tweaked the UI to include an iteration field for creating multiple output videos in a single request. This should make testing more efficient.
    - More code refactoring and commenting.


Wednesday 24/07:

    - More UI improvements.
    - Added time estimation to the UI to give a better idea of processing times.
    - Documented the UI changes and why they were made.
    - Continued code refactoring and adding comments.
    - Started digging into DeepFaceLab's repo to understand the technologies they use.


Thursday 25/07:

    - Tried re-testing the speech-to-speech conversion.
    - Still running into errors; the library seems unstable.
    - Decided to pause further testing on speech-to-speech conversion until there's a more stable library version.
    - Wrote down why this decision was made.
    - Kept researching DeepFaceLab's tech, focusing on how they implement things.


Friday 26/07:

    - Finalized and tested the UI changes; everything works as expected.
    - Wrote up justifications for each decision made this week, including:
        - The instability of the speech-to-speech conversion library.
        - Adding the iteration field and time estimation in the UI.
        - Issues with the speech detection script.
    - Compiled and committed all updates to the Git repository.
    - Continued looking into DeepFaceLab's tech and documenting findings.
    - Finished code refactoring and made sure all relevant sections are well-commented
