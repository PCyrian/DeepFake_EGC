# DeepFake_EGC

## Overview

This repository is for developing an automated deepfake pipeline, created during an internship at ICube laboratories, Strasbourg.

## Features

- **Audio Processing**: Extract and clone audio using various TTS models.
- **GUI**: Basic user interface with two fields and two buttons for managing video outputs.
- **Face Swap Prototypes**: Initial prototypes using OpenCV.
- **Lipsyncing**: Automatic lipsyncing implementations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Threading and other optimizations.

## Current Tasks

- Implementing speech detection to sync TTS with video.
- Continuous testing and refinement of speech-to-speech conversion.
- Research on DeepFaceLab technologies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py` to start the application.
4. Check `update.txt` for progress and changes.
